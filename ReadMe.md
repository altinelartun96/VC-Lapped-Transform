# DCT-Lapped LPIPS Compression Ratio

This project explores a novel approach to audio compression by combining Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Lapped Orthogonal Transform (LOT) techniques with the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) metric. The aim is to optimize compression ratios while preserving perceptual audio quality.

## Overview

The project investigates how DCT and LOT can be employed to compress audio signals efficiently and evaluates the quality of the compressed audio using the LPIPS metric. This approach helps in understanding the trade-offs between compression efficiency and perceived audio quality.

## Features

- **Audio Compression**: Utilizes DCT and LOT for effective audio compression.
- **Perceptual Quality Evaluation**: Measures perceptual audio quality using LPIPS.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compares different compression techniques to find the optimal balance between compression and quality.

## Getting Started

To begin using this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Run the main script to process audio files and evaluate compression performance. The results will be stored in the designated output directory.

## Directory Structure

- `data/`: Contains input audio files.
- `results/`: Stores results and output files.
- `src/`: Contains source code for compression algorithms and evaluation metrics.
- `main.py`: Script for running the compression and evaluation processes.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Fork the repository and submit a pull request with your proposed changes. Ensure to include appropriate tests and documentation.
